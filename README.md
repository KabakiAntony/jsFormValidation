# jsFormValidation


this is a simple one page document that shows a signup page
it shows form validation onsubmit

it uses html5, css3 and vanilla js 

the reason I am using the most simplest of elements 
is you have to understand how to use them before moving on
to things like bootstrap, sass , and other js frameworks for 
the frontend.
