# jsFormValidation


This is a simple one page document that shows a signup page
it shows form validation onsubmit

It uses html5, css3 and vanilla js.

The reason I am using the most simplest of elements 
is you have to understand how to use them before moving on
to things like bootstrap and the js frameworks for 
the frontend.

And feel free to copy the code and don't worry about the colors
it works change the colors to fit your taste.
